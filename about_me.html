								<h3>Education</h3>
								<p align="justify"> I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2021 from the Islamic University of Technology, 
									administered by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Bangladesh. Following my undergraduate studies, 
									I enrolled in the Master's program at the same institution in the same field, with an expected completion date of May 2024. 
									Currently, I am actively exploring opportunities to further advance my academic journey through a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering.</p>

								<h3>Hobby</h3>
								<p align="justify">I am deeply passionate about photography, with a specific focus on capturing the beauty of nature. 
									Through photography, I find a medium to express my inner emotions and enhance my observational skills. 
									Immersing myself in nature through photography not only allows me to get intimately closer to it but also serves 
									as a rejuvenating escape for my mind. Visit my
